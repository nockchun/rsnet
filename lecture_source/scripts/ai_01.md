1. Generally, all layers in Keras need to know the shape of their inputs in order to be able to create their weights. So when you create a layer like this, initially, it has no weights:
1. It creates its weights the first time it is called on an input, since the shape of the weights depends on the shape of the inputs:
1. You can create a Sequential model by passing a list of layers to the Sequential constructor:
1. Also note that the Sequential constructor accepts a name argument, just like any layer or model in Keras. This is useful to annotate TensorBoard graphs with semantically meaningful names.
1. It's layers are accessible via the layers attribute:
1. You can also create a Sequential model incrementally via the add() method:
