1. hello and welcome to kubernetes tutorial.
1. kubernetes is an open source technology developed by google in order to make orchestrating containerized applications esier.
1. that's why an official definition of kubernetes is actually a container orchestration tool.
1. so as you can see containers are the base part of kubernetes technology.
1. so if you want to learn kubernetes you first have to understand what a container is and why we use them.
1. so in this video series we'll talk about container concepts and one of it's most popular implementations which is docker.
1. so we'll talk about what a container is and what problems it solves.
1. we will also look at a container repository which is basically a storage for containers.
1. we'll see how container can actually make the development process much eaiser and more efficient.
1. and also how they solve some of the problems that we have in the deployment process of applications.
1. so let's dive right into it what a container is.
1. a container is a way to package applications with everything they need inside of that package including the dependencies and all the configuration necessary.
1. and that package is portable just like any other artifact is
1. and that package can be easily shared and moved around between a development team or development and operations team
1. and that portability of containers plus everything packaged in one isolated environment gives it some of the advantages that makes development and deployment process more efficient.
1. and we'll see some of the examples of how that works in later slides.
1. so as i mentioned containers are portable.
1. so there must be some kind of a storage for those containers.
